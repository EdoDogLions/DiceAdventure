DiceAdventure is an application that generates clashes against random entities in a combat simulator that partially simulates the famous game Dungeons and Dragons.

The design aims to generate 1-on-1 combat between two units, allowing the player to go on only once each enemy is defeated.

The game consists of 10 levels of increasing difficulty, after each level the player will restore part of his total health to simplify his continuation.
